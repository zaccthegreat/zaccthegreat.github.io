              <p>My name is Zacchaeus Day I'm a Senior IT Specialist. From an early age, I've been creative, playing musical instruments to building legos to doing photography and drawing. It wasn't until I reached high school and the technology teacher introduced me to the world of computers.</p>
              <p>It was a life-changing experience; I immediately gravitated to it. In my Junior and Senior year of high school, I took as many technology elective classes as possible to learn about web design and computer repair. I took my newly discovered passion and taught myself everything I could.</p>
              <p>As the years have gone by my love for learning and using new technologies hasn't dwindled.</p>
